`PBpatterns` is a package to assist with calculating physical behavior variables
in temporally-focused analyses. Examples include sedentary pattern variables
(e.g., fragmentation index, Gini index, and alpha), sedentary profiles, and
bouts of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.

## Installation

The package is under development and will not be released on CRAN for quite
awhile (if ever). But you can install from GitHub with the following:

``` r
remotes::install_github("paulhibbing/PBpatterns")
```

## Vignettes

For demonstrations of the main functions in `PBpatterns`, please see:
